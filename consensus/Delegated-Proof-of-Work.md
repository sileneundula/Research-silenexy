# Delegated Proof of Work

A novel delegated proof of work system that uses multiple validating nodes that are selected by PoW. MiniPow is used by the nodes and they earn rewards from completing pow based on delegates it is used for.

## Goals

### 1. Increase Community Outreach

DPOS/DPOW increase community outreach.

- ★ **Passive Earning** with `DPOW` while achieving consensus based on pow.

### 2. Increase Transparency

Increase transparency of Delegates.

### 3. Monetary Incentives For Voting Based On PoW

Tokens are granted to the user for pow. Other factors can be used to add more incentives depending on delegate.

### 4. Limit Delegation Profits

Limit the delegation profits so they are forced to keep transparency and ones trying to only earn monetary incentives can, but will help with decentralization, and be less centralized.

## Types

### DPOW-5

DPOW-5 is where 5 validators are selected and proof of work is done by the node in minipow to achieve consensus. The more pow done for the delegate and more completed proof-of-work, the more powerful the delegate is.

These proof-of-works use tokens that reward the user for completing the proof-of-work.

DPOW-5 can also be extended with proof-of-work-service (POW-S) where depending on the delegate, different attributes can be applied.
