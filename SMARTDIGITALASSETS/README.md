# Smart Digital Assets (SDA)

## Description

Smart Digital Assets are NFTs or Digital Assets that combine the usage of smart contracts and extensions, as well as layering to provide a new way for digital assets to interact with one another.

For example, digital asset extensions are labeled:
- **Memo**
  - This memo can be used to use a digital asset to comment on another digital asset and make a relationship between them. This memo field could hold any sort of significance to the digital asset.
- **Relational**
  - Used to establish a relationship between digital assets which can further be used for other extensions.
- **Layering**
  - Layer your digital asset with other properties
- **Forking**
  - Fork digital assets with respect to the original asset 

A `u64` is used for extensions to provide all future-proof cases with each extension defined in a repository for usage.

An extension is used to expand on the digital asset and needs a clear language to determine its properties. These languages can be used such as the **Move Lang** or other languages.
